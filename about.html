			<h1>About Cody!</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>Hi there! I'm Cody, a Midwesterner putting down roots in Scandinavia a hoping to find the meaning of life in "hygge" and "smørrebrød". I was born and raised in Iowa but fell in love with Denmark while studying abroad in college and I still can't believe that four years later I'm back working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen.</p>
			<p>Along the way I've lived in Germany and Estonia and visited most of Europe in an effort to find the best local cuisine and chinese food. It's been a delicious journey. My wanderlust isn't restricted to "reality", though, and I often look to books, TV, and film to discover new worlds. BBC greats such as Doctor Who and Sherlock, as well as US dramas such as Supernatural and Breaking Bad have stolen my heart. George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) shares the throne with Ender's Game for my favorite fantasy and sci-fi books.</p>
			<p>I occassionally go somewhere or make something cool and write about it, so you can follow along on <a href="{{ site.blogurl }}">my new blog</a> to stay informed. You can also read about my previous adventures abroad on <a href="{{ site.oldblogurl }}">my old blog</a>.</p>

			<h4>WHAT I DO</h4>
			<p>My education is in Software Engineering and my early work and personal project experience was primarily in Java and Android based applications including <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mobile/gwdb.html">this Guild Wars 2 Android app</a> on the google play store and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mobile/vtgraph.html">this Android app</a> made for a research team. I also have some experience as a Teaching Assistant for a Big-Data course touching on Hadoop MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Streams processing. More recently I've been buidling node.js apps and sites including several extensions for Visual Studio Code. Checkout my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> for a bigger sample of my work.</p>
			<p>In addition to technical skills, I have worked hard to develop several soft skills. I've shared my passions with others through tours, outreach and recruitment events, and serving as a liason to international students to build my "Evangelist" skills.</p>
