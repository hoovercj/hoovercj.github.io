			<h1>About Cody!</h1>
			<hr />
			<p>Hi there! I'm Cody, a Midwesterner putting down roots in Scandinavia a hoping to find the meaning of life in "hygge" and "smørrebrød". I was born and raised in Iowa but fell in love with Denmark while studying abroad in college and I still can't believe that four years later I'm back working as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen.</p>
			<p>Outside of work, I spent most of my time training for marathons and knitting shawls that are too big to wear but too small to be blankets.</p>
			<p>I occassionally go somewhere or make something cool and write about it, so you can follow along on my <a href="{{ site.blogurl }}">blog</a> to stay informed.</p>

			<h4>WHAT I DO</h4>
			<p>I'm a Software Engineer at Microsoft with a strong focus on accessibility, meaning that I make sure our products work for <b>all</b> of our users, regardless of any impairments they may have to their vision, mobility, or otherwise. Outside of work I've built a handful of extensions for the development tool Visual Studio Code as well as some tools to help me with my running. Checkout my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> for a bigger sample of my work.</p>
