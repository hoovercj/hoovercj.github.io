			<h1>About Cody!</h1>
			<hr>
			<p>Hi there! I'm Cody, a recent college graduate hoping to find the meaning of life in the bottom of a chinese takeout dinner. I grew up in Iowa and stuck around to get my Software Engineering degree at Iowa State. Along the way I spent a semester studying in Denmark and made a return visit at the invitation of LEGO visit their headquarters. In transit I caught the travel bug and haven't stopped since.</p>
			<p>I'm currently killing time studying Danish and Spanish in Estonia before I start full-time as a Software Engineer at Microsoft Development Center Copenhagen in Denmark early in 2016. You can follow my adventure at <a href="{{ site.blogurl }}">my new blog</a> to stay informed. You can also read about my previous adventures abroad on <a href="{{ site.oldblogurl }}">my old blog</a>. Lastly, check out the video below to hear my take on what it means to be a software engineer.</p>
			<p>My wanderlust isn't restricted to "reality" and I often look to books, TV, and film to discover new worlds. BBC greats such as Doctor Who and Sherlock, as well as CW dramas such as Supernatural have stolen my heart. George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire (Game of Thrones) shares the throne with Ender's Game for my favorite fantasy and sci-fi books.

			<h4>WHAT I DO</h4>
			<p>My education is in Software Engineering and my early work and personal project experience was primarily in Java and Android based applications including <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mobile/gwdb.html">this Guild Wars 2 Android app</a> on the google play store and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/mobile/vtgraph.html">this Android app</a> made for a research team. I also have some experience as a Teaching Assistant for a Big-Data course touching on Hadoop MapReduce, Pig, Hive, and Streams processing. More recently I've been buidling node.js apps and sites. Checkout my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio.html">portfolio</a> for a bigger sample of my work.</p>
			<p>In addition to technical skills, I have worked hard to develop several soft skills. I've shared my passions with others via giving monthly presentations to potential students, weekly campus tours, and serving as a liason to international students I've built what I call "Evangelist" skills.</p>
