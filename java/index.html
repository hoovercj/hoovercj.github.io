<p>In my Technical Writing course I was tasked with writing a tutorial for something that all people entering my field of study would encounter. The first thing new software developers do when they need to learn a new language, including their first, is some form of "Hello World" tutorial. Each language is different, and even different tutorials for the same language can vary significantly. However, all of these tutorials introduce both the form and the function of a language. Mine aims to be as approachable as possible for new programmers, and includes a complete glossary of terms. Go ahead, even if you don't know how to program you can check it out and let me know what you think.</p>
