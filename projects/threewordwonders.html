<p>This project was a fun way to experiment with Semantic UI, refresh my memory of knockout, and play with some new api's such as <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/api/">flickr</a>, Google <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/">static maps</a>, and <a href="http://what3words.com/">what3words</a>. I converted a csv dump of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites into json and using two-way binding via knockout randomly cycle through the list while fetching flickr photos, maps, and more. View the result <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/unesco-three-word-wonders">here</a>.</p>
