I ran my first marathon in the fall of 2018 and followed up with two more in 2019 with the help of some wonderful training plans from the books "Advanced Marathoning" by Pete Pfitzinger and Scott Douglas and "Faster Road Racing" by Pete Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. The plans were great, but looking up my daily workouts in the books every morning was a real pain, so I turned to [a tool](https://defy.org/hacks/calendarhack/) by [@nanreh](https://github.com/nanreh/calendar-hack) to generate an ical file to put the plan into my calendar and have my daily workouts available directly on my phone.

This worked great for a while until I wanted to use a plan that wasn't supported. Their site wasn't available on github at the time, so I had to hack around in the browser to inject the plan I wanted, but eventially I made it generate the ical for me. I knew that wasn't sustainable, though, so I made my own version of the site which allowed editing plans in the browser or downloading a template to create your own.

It's now my go-to tool for setting up training plans! What are you waiting for? [It's Time to Run!](https://www.codyhoover.com/time-to-run/).
